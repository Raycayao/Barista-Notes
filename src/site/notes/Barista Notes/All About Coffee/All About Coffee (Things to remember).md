- Mucilage or Mesocarp
	- This is the flesh of the coffee fruit. Whilst the cherry is maturing, this layer becomes wealthy in sugars.
	
- Outer Skin or Epicarp
	- This is the outer skin of the cherry, changing from one perfect colour to another. Green, yellow, orange, and then finally the bright ripe red!
