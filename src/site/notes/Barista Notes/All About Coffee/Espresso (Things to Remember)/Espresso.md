#espresso 

Espresso is a concentrated coffee that is used as a base for many coffee based beverages whether it's hot or cold. It's made by pumping pressure and water into fine coffee grounds to extract a desired soluble (shot) (see [[Barista Notes/All About Coffee/Espresso (Things to Remember)/Shot of Espresso\|Shot of Espresso]]).

Espresso is brewed by forcing small amount of near boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. For additional info see ([[Barista Notes/All About Coffee/Espresso (Things to Remember)/Parts of an Espresso\|Parts of an Espresso]]).
