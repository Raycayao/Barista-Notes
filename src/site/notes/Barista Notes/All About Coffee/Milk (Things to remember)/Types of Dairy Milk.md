#Milk 
## Half-and-Half
- Blend of milk & cream 
- 12% Fat 
- More dense and creamy consistency than plain milk

## Whole Milk
- Around 4% fat
- Also brings with it a richness of texture on the palette

## Reduced Fat Milk 
- 1-2% fat
- Some loss of flavor & texture
- Benefits of not overdoing on the fat

## Skim Milk
- Skim/Fat-Free Milk 
- Contains no fat at all
- There's some loss of flavour
- Creates less foam that's not "Fluffy"
- May bring slight bit of sweetness that is not found in whole or other reduced fat varieties
